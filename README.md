### TODO

- Change the application's name from HelloJNI to HelloJSC
- Add other JSC test cases
- I'm not sure if we can leave the generated .lut.h files in runtime folder instead of generating them before compilation.
- I hacked jsc-android/jni/Source/JavaScriptCore/ctuils/Android.mk line 68 ~ line 82. If we build it on windows cygwin, only uio.c is involved. But on mac, WINDOWS_HOST_ONLY equal to 0 and mspace.c is involved, which leads to an error about bionic dependency. I hacked here to avoid mspace.c. Any how, libjs.so seems working well currently.
- gcc would raise an error if jsc-android/jni/Application.mk hasn't defined APP_OPTIM := release. I found the solution from here http://groups.google.com/group/android-ndk/browse_thread/thread/4dc0addd20cf23d0?tvc=2
